[Chase McCoy](https://chsmc.org/2024/10/unusual-brightness/):

> You might be aware of a visual effect related to HDR videos if you’ve ever scrolled Instagram on your iPhone—the pixels displaying the HDR content display in full brightness, while the rest of the screen is slightly dimmed.
>
> [...] The illustrations for Digital Divinity make use of this effect in a brilliant (literally) way by masking a pure white, HDR video such that parts of the illustration glow with an ethereal brightness. For devices that support displaying HDR content brighter than the rest of the screen, the effect is stunning.

This is a surreal effect from [Digital Divinity](https://restofworld.org/series/digital-divinity/) and Chase made [a really neat demo](https://lab.chasem.co/hdr-white-shinethrough) of this technique with the original Star Wars poster where the lightsaber appears to be tearing a hole straight through my screen.
