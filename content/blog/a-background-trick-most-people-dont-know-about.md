Here’s a fantastic trick with `background-attachment: fixed` from [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/):

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F5AuH6Ku8CE?si=cZCX0qsp7ey3gDGx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Huh! Also, doing a quick search for other cool things you can do with this trick, I found that Geoff already made a collection of [use cases for fixed backgrounds in CSS](https://css-tricks.com/use-cases-fixed-backgrounds-css/) years ago that’s worth checking out, too.
