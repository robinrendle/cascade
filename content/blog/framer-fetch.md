This doesn’t have much to do with CSS, but this new feature by Framer called [Fetch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd8A90dKYKc) caught my eye:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dd8A90dKYKc?si=3Urs9pX-zEkBTcjN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The reason why I mention this is because it shows a snapshot of what the future of web design tools might be: they’re not just going to allow you to draw pixels on a canvas, but allow you to build real, interactive software that pings a database.

That’s exciting to me! As a designer by day, I want to make better prototypes of my designs and using real data helps sell my ideas. But it also makes me a little fearful for the future of front-end development? I would see something like this as a prototyping tool, ready to give to a talented UI engineer to build properly once I’m finished with it, but I fear that folks will see this and think of ditching front-end developers altogether.
